                <h1>What was the All Out War arc in Mundo dos Blocos series?</h1>
                <p>The All Out War, the final arc from <strong>Mundo dos Blocos</strong>, was a catastrophic event resulting from  Apyr's plan to <strong>eliminate all the Raska of the multiverse</strong>. After Raze's defeat, Apyr absorbed her and consequently the other Raskas and caused a destruction with many deaths, <strong>mainly from Leonardo Tsakumo's group</strong>. After the defeat of the main group, and everything looking hopeless, they found the will to fight once again, after a long training session and orchestrating a plan to defeat Apyr and stop his plan. </p>

                <h1>More about the fight</h1>
                <p>Apyr's plan consisted of <strong>unifying several planets with the <a href="comingsoon.html">Blue Sun</a></strong>, creating a kind of solar system, and using a specific amount of Raska in it, would create a <strong>distortion in the multiverse</strong>, allowing Apyr to merge with it and initiate the <strong><a href="comingsoon.html">The Closure</a></strong>, the name given to the plan. The entire fight took place in an unnamed city, which was a <strong>physical projection made of the solar system's soul and its own Raska</strong>. The city had a neon appearence.</p>
                <p><strong>5 years</strong> after Apyr's plan debut, <strong><a href="comingsoon.html">The Coalition</a></strong>, name given to the alliance formed to prevent further chaos, began the offensive, with <strong>Leonardo Tsakumo being the main figure and distraction</strong>, doing everything he could to keep Apyr busy long enough for the rest to destroy all the planets Apyr was using to form the cataclysm which would wipe out the whole of Raska.</p>

                <p>Leonardo Tsakumo, in this arc, is <strong>5 years older than when he fought Apyr for the first time</strong>. All the scars on his face are the result of the first attempt to stop Apyr. However, these were so deep that they <strong>couldn't even heal at all</strong>, unlike all the other injuries he's had throughout the series.
